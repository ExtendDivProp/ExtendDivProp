This is the git repository containing the implementation used for the paper " Linearly equivalent S-boxes and the Division Property".

This was tested with Sagemath 6.8 and Gurobi 8.0.1
Note that not everything is online yet, as the code needs a bit of cleaning before being public.

However a part of it should work fine already, especially some function in RECTANGLE.sage :
 - newRECTANGLEDistinguisher10r : Allow to check the new distinguisher over 10 rounds of RECTANGLE
 - oldRECTANGLEDistinguisher9r : Allow to check the old best known distinguisher over 9 rounds of RECTANGLE
 - twkRECTANGLEDistinguisher8r : Allow to check the distinguisher over 8 rounds of the variant of RECTANGLE
 - extend_RECTANGLE : Apply the extension technique to compute all sets K^j_{k_i^0} for RECTANGLE

 - oldPRESENTDistinguisher9r : Allow to check the old best known distinguisher over 9 rounds of PRESENT
 - twkPRESENTDistinguisher7r : Allow to check the distinguisher over 7 rounds of the variant of PRESENT
 - extend_PRESENT : Apply the extension technique to compute all sets K^j_{k_i^0} for PRESENT

This will be updated over time.
