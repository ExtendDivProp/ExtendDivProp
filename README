This is the git repository containing the implementation used for the paper "Extending the Division Property with Linear Mappings".

This was tested with Sagemath 6.8 and Gurobi 8.0.1
Note that not everything is online yet, as the code needs a bit of cleaning before being public.

However a part of it should work fine already, especially some function in RECTANGLE.sage :
 - newRECTANGLEDistinguisher10r() : Allow to check the new distinguisher over 10 rounds of RECTANGLE
 - oldRECTANGLEDistinguisher9r() : Allow to check the old best known distinguisher over 9 rounds of RECTANGLE
 - twkRECTANGLEDistinguisher8r() : Allow to check the distinguisher over 8 roudns of the variant of RECTANGLE

More documentation, and the complete code, will be uploaded over time.
